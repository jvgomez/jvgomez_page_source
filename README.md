Pelican-based static website. Feel free to use whatever you want :)

####DEPENDENCIES
In order to be able to create the site with Pelican, the following dependencies must be installed:

- `mdx-video` (YouTube video embedding by providing only the link).
```bash
$ sudo pip install mdx-video`
```
- `beautifulsoup4` (required by the extract_toc Pelican plugin)
```bash
$ sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
```
- `extract_toc` Pelican plugin (create tables of contents). Already included in this code.

#### Pelican theme
The code of this site is designed to work with a self-made modification of the `tuxlite_tbs` pelican theme. You can find my version in this repo:

https://github.com/jvgomez/tuxlite_tbs

If you use other themes, some thinkgs would probably fail.
