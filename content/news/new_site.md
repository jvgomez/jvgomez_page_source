Title: New site
Date: 2014-11-26 2:02

Yes! Finally! I have a new site.

After my experience with [OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/) and how their documentation is set, I have decided to use Markdown to generate a static site and host in Github pages. Now is much easier and faster for me to add new content and the hosting will be much faster (the previous was down all the time!).

I am using Pelican, an amaing Python-based static site generator. I am leaving the links to Pelican, Jinja2 and Python in the website menu, just because it is that cool I was to share them!

Enjoy my new website!
