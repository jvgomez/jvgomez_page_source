Title: SGPS paper published!
Date: 2014-12-24 19:00

We, me and some friends, finally published our research about applying [SGPS](http://sgpsproject.sourceforge.net/wiki) in a distributed sensor network. We are able to improve the SGPS positioning accuracy with a high percentage! It is an open-access paper, so [check it out!](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdsn/2014/564072/)

Due to my academic obligations, I have no more time to continue developing SGPS. However, I will be pleased to help anybody interested in this system and its development. Hopefully I will come back to it in the future.
