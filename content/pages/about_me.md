## Info
__TL;DR:__ I am technology enthusiast!

Robotics and automation Ph.D. from the [RoboticsLab](http://roboticslab.uc3m.es/roboticslab/) at [Carlos III University of Madrid](http://www.uc3m.es/Home). Currently working at [Rapyuta Robotics](http://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/) where I have fun and do cool stuff full-time!

My research interests interests:

1. high-level planning algorithms: robot formations, previous experience...
2. low level planning algorithms: improving computational time.
3. 3D mapping (as a hobby).
4. GPS-less global positioning systems (as a hobby).

Side interests include open-source robotics, mainly [OMPL](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org), and GPS-less global positioning systems, [SGPS](http://sgpsproject.sourceforge.net/wiki).

My hobbies are mountain biking, hiking and travelling. In fact, I have lived in:

1. Madrid, Spain.
2. Oslo, Norway.
3. Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
4. Stuttgart, Germany.
