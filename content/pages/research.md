## Robotics and AI

Mainly I focus on two big fields: path planning (learning, multirobot planning...) and 3D point cloud processing/environment modeling.

### Path Planning
Most of my research is based in the __Fast Marching Method__ and a custom version: [__Fast Marching Square (FM2)__]({filename}/pages/research/fm2.md).

This research is carried out within the [UC3M RoboticsLab](http://roboticslab.uc3m.es/).

### 3D Point Cloud Processing and Environment Modeling
Not too much has been done so far in this area. These are some small works I did to introduce myself in this fascinating world. Most of my work in this area is as a Bachelor's thesis advisor.

## SGPS
Find a way out to localize outdoor objects using energy efficient systems and algorithms. It is a continuation of my Bacherlor's thesis, collaborating with Frode Eika Sadness and Peyman Mirtaheri. Research based on the Frode's paper: _An energy efficient localization strategy for outdoor objects based on intelligent light-intensity sampling_.

I've created a Wiki in which all the code and useful information is uploaded to spread the idea and SGPS so everybody can research about it and get a real good system: [SGPSProject](http://sgpsproject.sourceforge.net/wiki)

This is a personal research which I carry out with some friends.
