Title: Software
Category: Main

[TOC]

Here I summarize the main pieces of software I have developed. I mainly use [Github](http://github.com/jvgomez/) and [Biicode](https://www.biicode.com/jvgomez), but I also use [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/jvgomez). Check these accounts if you want to see all my worthy-to-show software.

Following I am detailing the pieces I consider more important.

### Fast Marching
An SDK to use and benchmark Fast Marching Methods. It contains many different methods, benchmarking capabilites and Fast Marching Square path planning methods.

### CForest - Google Summer of Code 2014
I participated as a student in the [Google Summer of Code 2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) for the [Open Motion Planning Library](ompl.kavrakilab.org). The output was some improvements to OMPL plus the CForest framework, a multithreaded algorithm which runs many instances of the same path planner and shares solution among threads, so that the convergence to the optimal solution is boosted.

### SGPS
My very first attempt into the open source world. A library which contains all the code I developed for my SGPS papers. Although its design is probably not the best, I have to say it has been very useful for me.

- [Github repository](https://github.com/jvgomez/sgps)
- [Student Thesis]({filename}/pages/other_works/theses/irivero.md) working on the library.
