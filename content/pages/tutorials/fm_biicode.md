[TOC]

Along this tutorial, I will show you how to execute my __Fast Marching Method__ code uploaded to [Biicode](https://www.biicode.com/). You will realize how easy is to use this tool.

## Theoretical background

The path planning algorithms employed in this section are the __Fast Marching Method__ and the __Fast Marching Square__ method. Those methods are really similar to Dijkstra's method: From a given point, the distance of all the surrounding points is computed incrementally. Somehow, it is like if we are propagating a wave from the start point. This wave explores the whole map until the goal point is found. This process creates a distances map which says "how far" every point is from the start point. Then, if we apply gradient descent method from the goal point, we will reach the start point following the minimum-distance path.

Fast Marching Square substitutes the term _distance_ by _arrival time_. In this case, the wave does not propagate at constant velocity. It propagates slower as it gets close to obstacles. At the end, the distances map obtained is very similar. However, when gradient descent is run, the path obtained is safer (it does not get close to obstacles) and smoother. These are desirable properties when applied to robotics.

If you interested in deeply understand the algorithms, take a look at my [Research section]({filename}/pages/research/fm2.md).

The underlying Fast Marching code relies on a rather complex [__nDGridMap class__]({filename}/pages/other_works/ndgridmap.md): A datastructure representing a n dimensional grid map.

## Requirements

* Download and install [Biicode](https://www.biicode.com/downloads).

* Boost 1.54 (probably previous versions would work as well) should be installed in the __default directory__.

* Although it is provided by default with Ubuntu, libx11-dev should be installed in order to use CImg dependency (automatically managed by Biicode).

* Be sure you have a C\++11-compliant compiler. In my case, I am using g++ 4.8.2.

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The code provided lacks most of the error checkings(loading a wrong/inexistent file, clicking in obstacles, etc) since I aimed to keep it simple and readable.</dd></dl>

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This tutorial is written to work in Ubuntu. The Fast Marching code has not been tested in other platforms, although I think it should work in other OS.</dd></dl>

## Are you in a hurry? Try this:

    :::bash
    $ mkdir fmtutorial
    $ cd fmtutorial
    $ bii init
    $ bii open jvgomez/fmexamples
    $ bii cpp:build
    $ ./bin/jvgomez_fmexamples_main

Click in any two white points of the map. In my case I clicked in the red circles (first start at top-left, then goal at bottom-right):

<div class="figure align-left" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
<img alt="Input map" src="{filename}/images/fm_biicode/map.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
<p></p>
<p class="caption">Input map used in the example with the start and goal regions marked as red circles.</p>
<!--
<p class="legend"> This is a legend</p>
-->
</div>

Then, Fast Marching Method will run and you will see 2 outputs:

* First, the distances map. It computes the minimum Euclidean distance from any point on the map to the start point, while avoiding obstacles (note how cool it is, you can do zoom, just select an area with the mouse, and double click to undo zoom).

* Second (close the previous window to continue with the program), the final path obtained when gradient descent is applied from the given start point.

<div class="figure align-left" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
<img alt="FMM distances map" src="{filename}/images/fm_biicode/distances.png" style="width: 49%; height: auto;"/>
<img alt="FMM path" src="{filename}/images/fm_biicode/path.png" style="width: 49%; height: auto;"/>
<p></p>
<p class="caption">Left - FMM distances map. Right - Path obtained running gradient descent.</p>
<!--
<p class="legend"> This is a legend</p>
-->
</div>

And my console output was the following:

<pre><span style="color:#000000">jabuntu14@ubuntu:~/bii_ws/fmtutorial$ ./bin/jvgomez_fmexamples_main</span><span style="color:#0000ff">
<b>[INFO] Click in the initial and goal points.
[INFO] Testing Fast Marching Method.
</b> </span><span style="color:#000000">   Elapsed FMM time: 124 ms</span> <span style="color:#0000ff">
<b>[INFO] Plotting the results: Fast Marching distances map and path.</b></span></pre>

Congratulations! You just created, configured, compiled and run a path planning algorithm. With any other library this could have taken hours even if you are experienced.

### Let's take a look at what happened

</div>

Actually, a lot of things happened that made our work much easier! Take a look at the file tree automatically generated in our fmtutorial folder (right thumbnail picture).

You can see the [example code here](https://www.biicode.com/jvgomez/jvgomez/fmexamples/master/0/main.cpp).

With the set of commands give above we:

* Set a Biicode project folder (bii init)

* Get the Biicode block __jvgomez/fmexamples__ (bii open jvgomez/fmexamples)

* Automatically get all the required dependencies, configure the CMake project and compile it. We actually have very few dependencies:

<!-- -->

    :::cpp
    #include "jvgomez/fmm/fmm/fastmarching.hpp" // Fast Marching
    #include "jvgomez/fmm/io/maploader.hpp"     // Load map from image
    #include "jvgomez/fmm/io/gridplotter.hpp"   // Plot map
    #include "jvgomez/fmm/io/gridpoints.hpp"    // Enable point selection by clicking
    #include "jvgomez/fmm/gradientdescent/gradientdescent.hpp" // Gradient descent


However, these files recursively have some other dependencies: CImg and other jvgomez blocks. Biicode manages all that __automatically__ so all dependencies are obtained and the CMake project is successfully created.

A very important point is that you did not specify the compilation flags (such as C++11) or the dependencies to X11 required by CImg. Those were already included in the `jvgomez/fmexamples` block, but they are automatically downloaded when you opened the block. Isn't that awesome?

## That is cool, but I want more!
OK, OK. Let us now modify the code so we can use the Fast Marching Square algorithm, available in the [__endher/fm2__ block](https://www.biicode.com/endher/endher/fm2/master). For that, go to `blocks/jvgomez/fmexamples/` , open
with your favourite editor the `main.cpp` file and carry out the following modifications:

- Deactivate FastMarching algorithm: comment lines 22, 58, 62, 64.
- Activate FastMarching2 algorithm: uncomment lines 23, 59, 63, 64.

And then, with a terminal open in the fmtutorial folder (as before), type the following commands:

	:::bash
    $ bii find
    $ bii cpp:build
    $ ./bin/jvgomez_fmexamples_main

Et voil√°! You have now the Fast Marching Square algorithm running and Biicode managed the dependenies for you (since a new block is required). The new path should look something like:

<div class="figure align-right" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
<img alt="FM2 path" src="{filename}/images/fm_biicode/path2.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
<p></p>
<p class="caption">Fast Marching Square resulting path. Dependencies were automatically managed by Biicode</p>

</div>

## OK, you convinced me. Explain the code!
The Fast Marching code used implements a generalized, n-dimensional Fast Marching Method (and many different versions) using as main datastructure a n-dimensional gridmap (class `nDGridMap`). The code has been designed to that most of the complexity relies on the `nDGridMap` class. Therefore the Fast Marching algorithm is implemented in a way that it is completely independent of `nDGridMap`, so no dimensionality has to be taken into account.

In order to achieve this, together with a near-optimum performance, I used a policies-based design and a static-polymorphism approach. Most of the classes are templated: every `FastMarching` algorithm requires a grid type to work and a heap type (default is provided). For example, there are many different types of heaps, and changing the type given to the FastMarching class instance greatly affects in its performance, while the `FastMarching` code is exactly the same. Also, it does not mind if you are using a 2D grid, 3D grid, with `FMCells` (class used to represent each cell of the gridmap used together with `FastMarching`) or any other kind of cells or gridmap, as long as a minimum interface (set of class methods) is satisfied.

Therefore, the main code blocks are the following:

1. First, we declare the constant ndims and some other additional variables.

        :::cpp
        constexpr int ndims = 2; // Setting two dimensions.
        time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> start, end;
        double time_elapsed;`

2. We set the path the the file to open (hardcoded in this case). We also create a `nDGridMap` instance. Note that two policies (template parameters) are required: which kind of cells is the gridmap going to hold and how many dimensions. However, we do not know yet the size of each dimension. That depends on the map to be loaded, so we use the `MapLoader` static class to parse the map (binary image file) into a 2D `nDGridMap`. `fm2_sources` is an auxiliar variable useful only for Fast Marching Square. It keeps those indices in the map which are obstacles.

        :::cpp
        // Loading map and saving it into a grid.
        string filename("blocks/jvgomez/fmexamples/data/map.png");
        nDGridMap<FMCell, ndims> grid;
        vector<int> fm2_sources;
        MapLoader::loadMapFromImg(filename.c_str(), grid, fm2_sources);

3. Next, we want to introduce by clicking the start and goal points and we use the cool `console` static class to give nice console output. Since we know the dimensions of the map (2) we can use `std::arrays` to store the coordiantes of the initial and goal points. `coords_init` will be an array [x_init, y_init] and `coords_goal` [x_goal, y_goal]. Finally, `GridPoints` class is used: it plots the map and ask for the points to the user.

		:::cpp
        // Selecting initial and goal point.
        console::info("Click in the initial and goal points.");
        std::array<int, ndims> coords_init, coords_goal;
        GridPoints::selectMapPoints(grid, coords_init, coords_goal);

4. Before proceeding with the `FastMarching` algorithm, we first need to convert from coordinates to indices. The n-dimensional grid is actually a 1D vector so its cells have to be handled through indicies. Fortunatelly, the `nDGridMap` class contains the `coord2idx()` method which takes care of that for us:

		:::cpp
        vector<int> init_points;
        int idx, goal;
        grid.coord2idx(coords_init, idx);
        init_points.push_back(idx);
        grid.coord2idx(coords_goal, goal);

5. Now we can set the `FastMarching` instance! We create a `FastMarching` object with the kind of grid as policy. We then set the specific grid object, the initial and goal points (indices) and then we are ready to call `computeFM()`!. Some additional code is included to measure the elapsed time in the computation:

		:::cpp
        FastMarching< nDGridMap<FMCell, ndims> > fmm;
        fmm.setEnvironment(&grid);
            start = system_clock::now();
        fmm.setInitialAndGoalPoints(init_points, goal);
        fmm.computeFM();
            end = system_clock::now();
            time_elapsed = duration_cast<milliseconds>(end-start).count();
            cout << "\tElapsed FMM time: " << time_elapsed << " ms" << endl;

6. We also want to get the path, so the `GradientDescent` class is called. `Path` typename is actually a vector of 2D arrays, something like [x1 y1; x2 y2; x3 y3...] containing the path points. `path_velocity` stores the velocities profile for the given path (something out of focus for this tutorial). Again the type of `nDGridMap` is given as template parameter so `GradientDescent` knows how to do its work. Finally, the `apply()` method is called from the goal point:

		:::cpp
        typedef typename std::vector< std::array<double, ndims> > Path;
        Path path;
        std::vector <double> path_velocity; // Velocities profile

        GradientDescent< nDGridMap<FMCell, ndims> > grad;
        grad.apply(grid,goal,path,path_velocity);

7. Finally, let us make it beautiful and plot some results using the `GridPlotter` class:

		:::cpp
        console::info("Plotting the results: Fast Marching distances map and path.");
        GridPlotter::plotArrivalTimes(grid);
        GridPlotter::plotMapPath(grid,path);

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If you are thinking this is a complex design since template parameters are also templated... believe me, it is quite easy.</dd></dl>

Take a look at [these other examples](https://www.biicode.com/jvgomez/jvgomez/fm2examples/master/3/test_fm2.cpp). In this case, the gridmap type has been renamed so a specific type of gridmap looks like an independent class. Instead of using `nDGridMap<FMCell, 2>`, we can just say `FMGrid2D` by the corresponding typedef:

	:::cpp
    typedef nDGridMap<FMCell, ndims2> FMGrid2D;

So the calls can be simplified:

	:::cpp
    FastMarching< nDGridMap<FMCell, ndims> > fmm; --->  FastMarching< FMGrid2D > fmm;
