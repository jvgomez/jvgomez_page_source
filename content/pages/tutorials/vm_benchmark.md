Title: Virtual Machine Comparison through benchmarks
Category: Tutorials
Status: hidden

First point: I'm not an expert at Virtual Machines and that kind of things (well, I'm not an expert at anything... so far ^^).

The test I post here is a product of just curiosity. I wonder about which virtual machine program is better, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/). Each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages which I will not discuss now (there is a lot of information about this topic on the Internet).

Just some data data:
- Host SO: Windows 7 Professional 64b.
- Guest SO: Ubuntu 11.10 64b (same .iso for both tests).
- Main Hardware:  Intel Core 2 Quad CPU @ 2.40 GHz, 6GB RAM.
- Benchmark program: HardInfo 0.5.1 (Available at Ubuntu repositories).
- The versions of the virtual machine programs I have used is in the results spreadsheet.


- [Download the results]({filename}/files/docs/BenchmarkResults.xlsx).

In the light of the results...well, I still wonder which one is better! From my point of view, the results are quite similar. Some results are better, some are worse so no conclusion. I think it depends on the application and the hardware brand. I use VirtualBox... it is free and open-source :)

Soon, I will test both virtual machines with one simple program (which I am using for research) which consists on reading thousands of files and navigating through folders.

Of course, I will accept all your suggestions and comments!
